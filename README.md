# Tic-tac-toe-ember

This is a project I threw together to learn Ember.  It is not complete yet, but everyone's more than welcome to take a look.  In the long run, I intend to use WebSockets to implement multiplayer (locally at first, then beyond).

To see what I have thus far, I'd recommend starting the Ember server in the console `ember s`, then visiting `localhost:4200` in a browser.  If you'd like to use a different port, you can change the default with `ember s --port 8080` using 8080 as the desired port.
